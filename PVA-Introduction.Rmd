## Demographic models and population viability analysis (PVA)



## Calculating a population growth rate

Use census data from multi-year bottlenose dolphin census to calculate annual growth rates.

```{r bobblenose_census, eval=FALSE}
R <- rnorm(n = 25, mean = 1.05, sd = .01)

n_init <- 1000
n <- vector(length = length(R))

n_old <- n_init
for (t in 1:length(R)){
  n_new <- n_old * R[t]
  n[t] <- n_new
  n_old <- n_new
}

n <- floor(n)

n <- c(n_init, n)

bottlenose_census <- data.frame( year = 1990:2015,
                                 pop_size = n )

write.csv(file = "bottlenose_census.csv", x = bottlenose_census)

```
